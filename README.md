# Rhino-Shiny-Compount-Interest

This is a simple shiny app that calculates the compound interest of an investment. The user can input the initial investment, the interest rate, the number of years, and the number of times the interest is compounded per year. The app will then calculate the final amount of the investment.

What is number of times the interest is compounded per year?
The number of times the interest is compounded per year is the number of times the interest is added to the principal balance. For example, if the interest is compounded monthly, the interest will be added to the principal balance 12 times a year.

If interests are compounded daily for a 8 precent annual interest rate, the formula to calculate the daily interest rate is:

```
daily_interest_rate = (1 + 0.08)^(1/365) - 1
```

Really?

Yes, really.
